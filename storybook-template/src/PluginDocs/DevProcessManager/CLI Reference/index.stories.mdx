* There is list of certain commands which are available in this plugin.
  Below is a little description of those commands.

<br/>

* <details>
  <summary>
    <strong> develop:up</strong>
  </summary>

  <br/>

  * This command will run the **Plugin Instances** inside our docker.

    In order to run the docker container of all **Plugin Instances** we have created,
    we need to run the below command:

    <br/>

    ```
    node glue develop:up
    ```

    <br/>

  * In order to run a particular **Plugin Instance** we need to run command in the below pattern:

    <br/>

    ```
    node glue develop:up <Instance-Name>
    ```

    <br/>

    For example I have already added **Glue Plugin Postgres** in my app with my instance name as
    postgres. Then in order to only start our postgres instance I need to run following command:

    <br/>

    ```
    node glue develop:up postgres
    ```

    <br/>

    **Note:** Passing instance name is optional. If we don't pass the instance name then, it will
    start running all the instances

  <summary>
    <strong> develop:down</strong>
  </summary>

  <br/>

  * This command will stop running the **Plugin Instances** inside our docker.

    In order to stop the docker container of all **Plugin Instances** we have created,
    we need to run the below command:

    <br/>

    ```
    node glue develop:down
    ```

    <br/>

  * In order to stop a particular **Plugin Instance** we need to run command in the below pattern:

    <br/>

    ```
    node glue develop:down <Instance-Name>
    ```

    <br/>

    For example **Glue Plugin Postgres** is already running in my app with my instance name as
    **postgres**. Then in order to only stop our postgres instance I need to run following command:

    <br/>

    ```
    node glue develop:down postgres
    ```

    <br/>

    **Note:** Passing instance name is optional. If we don't pass the instance name then, it will

    <br/>

    ```
    node glue develop:list --filter <Instance-Name>
    ```

    <br/>

    For example we need to see details of **Glue Plugin Postgres** which we have already installed in our app with
    our instance name as **postgres**. Then in order to only stop our postgres instance I need to run following
    command:

    <br/>

    ```

  <br/>

  * This command will run our applicaion in **watch** mode. Whenever we save changes in our
    plugin instances which have **watch() function** included in them, then this command will
    automatically restart our **instance containers**. 

    It will **watch** for all those plugin instances inside which we have implemented **watch()
    function**.

    The **watch()** function should return an array of strings. Those strings are the **file
    path** upon which our application will run on watch mode.
    
    
    In order to run this command we need to enter the following command:

    <br/>

    ```
    node glue develop:watch
