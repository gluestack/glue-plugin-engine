- ## Working

  <br />

  - This plugin will give you certain list of commands in your **Glue App**
    in order to interact with your **Instances**.

  <br />

  - Those command will help you to run and manage your **Instances**.

  <br />

  - Behind the scene what happens is this plugin will configure itself with
    every other **Plugin Instances** you add and provide you commands to interact
    and manage your instances.
