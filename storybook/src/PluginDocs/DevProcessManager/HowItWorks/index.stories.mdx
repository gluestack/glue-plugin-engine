# How it works

##

<br />

- ## Working

  <br />

  - This plugin will give us certain list of commands in our **Glue App**
    in order to interact with our **Instances**.

  <br />

  - Those command will help us to run and manage our **Instances**.

  <br />

  - Behind the scene what will happen is this plugin will configure itself with
    every other **Plugin Instances** we add and will provide us command to interact
    and manage them.
